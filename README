StartupTemplate is your head-start on building an awesome web application. Here's how to get started.

INSTALLING STARTUPTEMPLATE

1. Download the zip file to your computer where you want your working directory.
2. Unzip the file and rename the /StartupTemplate/ folder to something appropriate for your project.
3. Make sure you have python 2.5 installed on your system and as the default (it's the latest GAE supports).
3.1. Install if you don't. :-)
4. Download/install GoogleAppEngineLauncher if you haven't.
5. Install coverage.py if you don't have it.
5.1. Don't have it? Not sure? Just type "easy_install coverage" into the terminal.
6. Inside your new folder is a file called app.yaml. The first line says "application: startuptemplate". Change that to
something appropriate for your project.
7. Open GoogleAppEngineLauncher and click the plus icon.
8. Leave the Application Name field blank and for Application Directory select your new folder. Click "Create".

Built into this template are the following tech and good best-practices:

* Google App Engine
* Webapp framework
* jinja2 templates
* python
* jquery
* far-future expires header
* simple routing
* a user model that can accept multiple login methods (gmail, openid)
* html5
* modernizr
* asynchronously loaded javascript
* google font loader
* css reset
* js profiling for admins
* user auto-loading and available on each template

All you need to do to start using this template is to pull the repository into your own directory, then add
the application to Google App Engine Launcher using File -> Add Existing Application. Then start making your models,
handlers, and templates, and you're good to go.

TODO
Future functionality will include split-testing... possibly continuous integration and
auto-minification of javascript and css.
